    <section>
        <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>By accessing or using Ember, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you disagree with any part of these terms, you may not use our service.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>2. Description of Service</h3>
        <p>Ember is an AI-powered dating assistant application that provides conversation suggestions and advice for various dating scenarios. The service is provided "as is" for entertainment and assistance purposes only.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>3. User Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>You agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the app responsibly and ethically</li>
            <li>Not upload or share content that violates others' privacy</li>
            <li>Not use the service for illegal or harmful purposes</li>
            <li>Not attempt to manipulate, harass, or deceive others</li>

        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>4. Important Disclaimers</h3>
        <div class="notice-box">
            <p><strong>No Guarantee of Results:</strong> Ember provides suggestions and advice, but we cannot guarantee specific outcomes in your dating life or relationships.</p>
            <p><strong>Not Professional Advice:</strong> Our service does not provide professional relationship counseling, therapy, or medical advice.</p>
            <p><strong>User Discretion:</strong> Always use your own judgment when communicating with others. You are solely responsible for your actions and communications.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>5. Privacy and Data</h3>
        <p>Your use of Ember is also governed by our Privacy Policy. By using the service, you consent to our collection and use of data as described in the Privacy Policy. <strong>Do not share sensitive personal information, PII, or confidential data through the app.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Data We Collect:</strong> We collect the following information to provide our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email address, user ID</li>
            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Screenshots, text conversations, calendar events, chat history</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Usage statistics, app activity, last activity timestamp</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device identifiers, push notification tokens, IP address</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Data:</strong> Subscription tier, payment provider, transaction IDs, subscription status, billing cycle, expiration dates</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Data Management:</strong> You can manage your data directly in the app. Chats are automatically deleted after the 15th item in the grid list, and you can also delete them manually at any time. Scheduled calendar dates are automatically deleted 1 day after the current date (meaning after the date has passed), and you can also delete them manually at any time. For complete data deletion, visit the Account Settings page or contact us.</p>

        <p><strong>Account Deletion Policy:</strong> Accounts that have been inactive for 1 year (365 days) with no active subscription will be automatically deleted. This includes all associated data (profile, chats, usage statistics, calendar events, and subscriptions). Users with active subscriptions are protected from automatic deletion. To prevent automatic deletion, simply log in or use the app at least once per year. You can also request immediate account deletion at any time through Account Settings or by contacting us.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>5.1 Subscriptions and Billing</h3>
        <p>Subscription purchases, billing, and account management are handled by the Apple App Store (and, when available, Google Play). Subscriptions auto‑renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device Account Settings. Prices may vary by region and are subject to change.</p>
        <div class="notice-box">
            <p><strong>Subscription Changes and Billing:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Upgrades:</strong> When you upgrade to a higher subscription tier (e.g., Free to Premium, Premium to Diamond), the new subscription starts immediately and you are charged immediately. You gain access to the higher tier's features right away.</li>
                <li style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Downgrades:</strong> When you downgrade to a lower subscription tier (e.g., Diamond to Premium), the change is scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing period. You are not charged immediately and will retain access to your current tier's features until the billing period ends. The new lower tier subscription will begin at that time.</li>
                <li style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Billing Cycle Changes:</strong> When you change your billing cycle for the same tier (e.g., Premium Monthly to Premium Weekly), the change is scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing period. You are not charged immediately and will retain your current billing cycle until it expires. The new billing cycle will begin at that time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pricing Disclaimer:</strong> Discount percentages shown for subscription plans (e.g., 15%, 30%, 45% off) are approximate and may fluctuate due to exchange rates and regional pricing variations. Actual savings may vary based on your local currency and the app store's pricing structure.</p>
        </div>
