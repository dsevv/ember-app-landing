        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>Ember ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our dating assistant application.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>BETA Version Notice</h3>
        <div class="notice-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Ember is currently in BETA testing. Features may change, and the service may be modified or discontinued. Please use responsibly and do not share sensitive personal information.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screenshots you upload for conversation analysis</li>
            <li>Text conversations you manually input</li>
            <li>App usage data and preferences</li>
            <li>Device information and identifiers</li>
            <li>Usage statistics (screenshots analyzed, responses generated)</li>
            <li>Push notification tokens (device-specific identifiers used to deliver notifications to your device)</li>
            <li>Calendar event data (dates, times, names) for scheduling reminder notifications</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We use your information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide AI-powered conversation suggestions</li>
            <li>Send push notifications for date reminders, subscription updates, usage warnings, and app review requests</li>
            <li>Schedule and deliver timely notifications based on your calendar events and subscription status</li>
            <li>Improve our service and user experience</li>
            <li>Analyze app performance and usage patterns</li>
            <li>Maintain and secure our platform</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <p>Your conversation data is stored locally on your device using secure browser storage. We implement industry-standard security measures including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate limiting and usage controls to prevent abuse</li>
            <li>Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs</li>
            <li>Secure HTTPS communication for all API requests</li>
            <li>Error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure</li>
            <li>Request size limits to protect server resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We recommend not sharing sensitive personal information through the app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>4.1 Data Retention</h3>
        <p>We retain only the minimum data necessary to provide the service. Most content you provide (e.g., screenshots, text inputs) is processed on-device or transiently and is not stored on our servers beyond what is required for usage tracking and core functionality. Aggregated, anonymized usage metrics may be retained to improve product quality and reliability.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>4.2 Data Management and Deletion</h3>
        <p>You have control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chats - Automatic Deletion:</strong> Chats are automatically deleted after the 15th item in the grid list to help manage storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Chats - Manual Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual chats and conversations manually at any time directly from the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Dates - Automatic Deletion:</strong> Scheduled dates are automatically deleted 1 day after the current date (meaning after the date has passed).</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Dates - Manual Deletion:</strong> You can delete scheduled dates manually at any time from the Calendar page.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of all your data by contacting us or visiting the Account Settings page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you delete chats or conversations, associated screenshots and data are permanently removed from your device. Data stored with third-party services (such as OpenAI) may be retained according to their own data retention policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>7. In‑App Subscriptions and Billing</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a subscription, billing and account management are handled by the Apple App Store (and, when available, Google Play). Subscriptions auto‑renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device Account Settings.</p>
        <div class="notice-box">
            <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> All subscription purchases and refunds are processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not process refunds directly. Refund requests are handled according to each app store's refund policy. To request a refund or view the refund policies, visit <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Support</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Help</a>, or use the "Report a Problem" / "Request a refund" feature in your account settings.</p>
            <p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time through your device's Account Settings. Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will retain access to premium features until that time. No refunds are provided for unused portions of a billing period after cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Pricing Disclaimer:</strong> Discount percentages shown for subscription plans (e.g., 15%, 30%, 45% off) are approximate and may fluctuate due to exchange rates and regional pricing variations. Actual savings may vary based on your local currency and the app store's pricing structure.</p>

        <h3>8. Analytics and Advertising</h3>
        <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to track website and app usage, including page views, user interactions, and traffic sources. This data is anonymized and helps us improve our service. See Section 6 for more details about Google Analytics.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising:</strong> We may introduce in‑app advertising (e.g., AdMob) in the future. If enabled, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe what data is used for ads personalization/measurement and provide controls for your preferences.</p>
        <p><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> We send push notifications to keep you informed about important events and updates. Notifications include:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>To send notifications, we collect and store a push notification token (a device-specific identifier) associated with your account. This token is required to deliver notifications to your device. You can disable push notifications at any time through your device settings. When you disable notifications, we will stop sending them, but your token may remain stored until you delete your account.</p>
