        <ul>
            <li>Provide AI-powered conversation suggestions</li>
            <li>Send push notifications for date reminders, subscription updates, usage warnings, and app review requests</li>

            <li>Maintain and secure our platform</li>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>4. Data Storage and Security</h3>
        <p>Your conversation data is stored locally on your device using secure browser storage. We implement industry-standard security measures including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rate limiting and usage controls to prevent abuse</li>
            <li>Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs</li>
            <li>Secure HTTPS communication for all API requests</li>
            <li>Error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure</li>
            <li>Request size limits to protect server resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We recommend not sharing sensitive personal information through the app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>4.1 Data Retention</h3>
        <p>We retain only the minimum data necessary to provide the service. Your data is stored securely in our database and is retained as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active Users:</strong> All data is retained while your account is active and you are using the service.</li>
            <li><strong>Inactive Users:</strong> Accounts that have been inactive for 1 year (365 days) with no active subscription will be automatically deleted. This includes all associated data (profile, chats, usage statistics, calendar events, and subscriptions).</li>
            <li><strong>Active Subscribers:</strong> Users with active subscriptions are protected from automatic deletion, even if inactive for extended periods, to ensure paying customers retain access to their data.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregated Data:</strong> Aggregated, anonymized usage metrics may be retained to improve product quality and reliability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Inactivity Definition:</strong> An account is considered inactive if there has been no login or API activity for 365 consecutive days. Activity is tracked through login events and API usage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>4.2 Data Management and Deletion</h3>
        <p>You have control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chats - Automatic Deletion:</strong> Chats are automatically deleted after the 15th item in the grid list to help manage storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Chats - Manual Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual chats and conversations manually at any time directly from the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Dates - Automatic Deletion:</strong> Scheduled dates are automatically deleted 1 day after the current date (meaning after the date has passed).</li>
            <li><strong>Calendar Dates - Manual Deletion:</strong> You can delete scheduled dates manually at any time from the Calendar page.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can request immediate deletion of all your data by contacting us or visiting the Account Settings page. Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Account Deletion:</strong> Inactive accounts (no activity for 1 year) with no active subscription will be automatically deleted monthly. You will receive no notification before automatic deletion. To prevent deletion, simply log in or use the app at least once per year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you delete chats or conversations, associated screenshots and data are permanently removed. When your account is deleted (manually or automatically), all associated data including profile, chats, usage statistics, calendar events, and subscription records are permanently deleted. Data stored with third-party services (such as OpenAI) may be retained according to their own data retention policies.</p>

        <h3>7. In‑App Subscriptions and Billing</h3>
        <p>If you purchase a subscription, billing and account management are handled by the Apple App Store (and, when available, Google Play). Subscriptions auto‑renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your device Account Settings.</p>
        <div class="notice-box">
            <p><strong>Subscription Changes and Billing:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin: 12px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Upgrades:</strong> When you upgrade to a higher subscription tier (e.g., Free to Premium, Premium to Diamond), the new subscription starts immediately and you are charged immediately. You gain access to the higher tier's features right away.</li>
                <li style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Downgrades:</strong> When you downgrade to a lower subscription tier (e.g., Diamond to Premium), the change is scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing period. You are not charged immediately and will retain access to your current tier's features until the billing period ends. The new lower tier subscription will begin at that time.</li>
                <li style="margin: 8px 0;"><strong>Billing Cycle Changes:</strong> When you change your billing cycle for the same tier (e.g., Premium Monthly to Premium Weekly), the change is scheduled to take effect at the end of your current billing period. You are not charged immediately and will retain your current billing cycle until it expires. The new billing cycle will begin at that time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> All subscription purchases and refunds are processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not process refunds directly. Refund requests are handled according to each app store's refund policy. To request a refund or view the refund policies, visit <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Support</a> or <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Help</a>, or use the "Report a Problem" / "Request a refund" feature in your account settings.</p>
            <p><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time through your device's Account Settings. Cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will retain access to premium features until that time. No refunds are provided for unused portions of a billing period after cancellation.</p>
            <p><strong>Pricing Disclaimer:</strong> Discount percentages shown for subscription plans (e.g., 15%, 30%, 45% off) are approximate and may fluctuate due to exchange rates and regional pricing variations. Actual savings may vary based on your local currency and the app store's pricing structure.</p>
        </div>

    <section>
        <h3>8. Analytics and Advertising</h3>
        <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to track website and app usage, including page views, user interactions, and traffic sources. This data is anonymized and helps us improve our service. See Section 6 for more details about Google Analytics.</p>
        <p><strong>Advertising:</strong> We may introduce in‑app advertising (e.g., AdMob) in the future. If enabled, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe what data is used for ads personalization/measurement and provide controls for your preferences.</p>
        <p><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> We send push notifications to keep you informed about important events and updates. Notifications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Date Reminders:</strong> Notifications 24 hours and 3 hours before scheduled dates</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Updates:</strong> Trial ending reminders, subscription expiration warnings, and renewal notices</li>

        </ul>
        <p>To send notifications, we collect and store a push notification token (a device-specific identifier) associated with your account. This token is required to deliver notifications to your device. You can disable push notifications at any time through your device settings. When you disable notifications, we will stop sending them, but your token may remain stored until you delete your account.</p>
